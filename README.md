## SigFig.cs - Rounding to Significant Figures

Uses the default of *round to even* for normal rounding.

I use `RoundUp` and `RoundDown` for estimating the max and min for the axes of plots. Rounded numbers make neat axes and significant figures make sure the  magnitude is suitable. Also makes dynamic axes for live data less jumpy.
